# Project Structure

This repo contains the modern Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) project, as well as some older or unrelated HTML/JS learning files. To keep things organized, here’s the recommended structure:

## Main Project
- `RPS-final.html` — Main, modern RPS game
- `style.css` — Styles for RPS
- `script.js` — JS for RPS
- `imagesRPS/` — Images for RPS

## Old Versions & Learning Files
- `archive/` — For old RPS versions and unrelated HTML/JS files
    - `RPSbasic.html`
    - `RPSbasic+.html`
    - `ArraysLoops.html`
    - `ToDoList.html`
    - `DomObj.html`
    - `Functions.html`
    - `JS_Objects.html`
    - `JSbooleanifs.html`
    - `JSwebsiteint.html`
- `HTML/` — Keep as is for HTML/CSS learning material

## How to Organize
1. Create an `archive/` folder in your project root.
2. Move all old/unrelated HTML files into `archive/`.
3. Keep only the main RPS files and folders in the root.
